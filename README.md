# Restaurant Revenue Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast restaurant revenue using advanced time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance employee planning and resource management for a restaurant in Heidelberg by predicting future revenues based on historical data, weather patterns, holidays, and other relevant factors.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering
- The dataset includes historical revenue data, weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation), and information on holidays.
- Feature selection was employed to identify the most significant variables for improving model accuracy.

### 2. Time Series Analysis with Lagged Features
- Lagged features such as previous daysâ€™ revenues and rolling averages (e.g., 3-day, 7-day) were added to capture temporal dependencies in the data and provide additional predictive context.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Several machine learning models were tested for the task, including **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and a hybrid model combining linear regression with XGBoost to better capture the increasing revenue trend over time.
- The hybrid model improved the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) from **0.1998** to **0.1732**, outperforming standalone models.

### 4. Model Optimization with Optuna
- Optuna, a framework for hyperparameter optimization, was used to fine-tune the XGBoost model using Bayesian optimization. The optimization further improved model performance, and XGBoost was chosen over LightGBM for the hybrid model due to its superior results.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Model performance was evaluated using MAPE, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The hybrid model demonstrated the best balance between accuracy and complexity.

### 6. Real-world Use Case: Employee Planning
- The revenue forecasts generated by the model are intended to improve employee scheduling and operational efficiency. By accurately predicting busy periods, the restaurant can better allocate staff and resources.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-revenue-forecasting.git
    cd restaurant-revenue-forecasting
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the forecasting model to generate revenue predictions.
